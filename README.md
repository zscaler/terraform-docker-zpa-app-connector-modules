# Zscaler App Connector Docker Terraform Modules

## Support Disclaimer

-> **Disclaimer:** Please refer to our [General Support Statement](docs/guides/support.md) before proceeding with the use of this provider.

## Description

This repository contains modules and deployment configurations that can be used to deploy Zscaler App Connector software on Docker containers to securely and quickly provision SCALANCE LPE-9000 (Local Processing Engine) and AXC F 3152 from Phoenix Contact  for industrial IoT (Internet of Things) device with a Linux Operating System.

These devices provide computing power for various applications in the network, and as a result you can use Docker to run your own applications.

These deployment templates are intended to be fully functional and self service for both greenfield/pov as well as production use.

## Prerequisites

Our Deployment scripts are leveraging Terraform v1.1.9 that includes full binary and provider support for MacOS M1 chips, but any Terraform version 0.13.7 should be generally supported.

- provider registry.terraform.io/kreuzwerker/docker v3.0.x
- provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/random v3.3.x
- provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/local v2.2.x
- provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/null v3.1.x
- provider registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tls v3.4.x
- provider registry.terraform.io/providers/zscaler/zpa v2.6.x

### Docker requirements

1. A valid AWS account
2. AWS ACCESS KEY ID
3. AWS SECRET ACCESS KEY
4. AWS Region (E.g. us-west-2)
5. Subscribe and accept terms of using Amazon Linux 2 AMI (for base deployments with workloads + bastion) at [this link](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-zc4x2k7vt6rpu)
6. Subscribe and accept terms of using Zscaler App Connector image at [this link](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-epy3md7fcvk4g)

### Zscaler requirements

This module leverages the [Zscaler ZPA Provider](https://github.com/zscaler/terraform-provider-zpa) to connect to your ZPA Admin console and provision a new App Connector Group + Provisioning Key. You can still run this template if deploying to an existing App Connector Group rather than creating a new one, but using the conditional create functionality from variable byo_provisioning_key and supplying to name of your provisioning key to variable byo_provisioning_key_name. In either deployment, this is fed directly into the userdata for bootstrapping

1. A valid Zscaler Private Access subscription and portal access
2. Zscaler ZPA API Keys. Details on how to find and generate ZPA API keys can be located [here](https://help.zscaler.com/zpa/about-api-keys)

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Customer ID

3. (Optional) An existing App Connector Group and Provisioning Key. Otherwise, you can follow the prompts in the examples terraform.tfvars to create a new Connector Group and Provisioning Key

See: [Zscaler App Connector Deployment Guide for Docker](https://help.zscaler.com/zpa/app-connector-deployment-guide-docker) for additional prerequisite provisioning steps.

## How to deploy

Provisioning templates are available for customer use/reference to successfully deploy fully operational App Connector containers once the prerequisites have been completed. Please follow the instructions located in [examples](examples/base_ac/README.md).

## Format

This repository follows the [Hashicorp Standard Modules Structure](https://www.terraform.io/registry/modules/publish):

- `modules` - All module resources utilized by and customized specifically for App Connector deployments. The intent is these modules are resusable and functional for any deployment type referencing for both production or lab/testing purposes.

- `examples` - Zscaler provides fully functional deployment templates utilizing a combination of some or all of the modules published. These can utilized in there entirety or as reference templates for more advanced customers or custom deployments. For novice Terraform users, we also provide a bash script (zsac) that can be run from any Linux/Mac OS or CSP Cloud Shell that walks through all provisioning requirements as well as downloading/running an isolated teraform process. This allows App Connector deployments from any supported client without needing to even have Terraform installed or know how the language/syntax for running it.

## Versioning

These modules follow recommended release tagging in [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). You can find each new release,
along with the changelog, on the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/zscaler/terraform-aws-zpa-app-connector-modules/releases) page.
